# ðŸ“¦ Context: We're using Pydantic v2
# In Pydantic v2, the configuration style changed. Now we use:

# model_config = {
#     "from_attributes": True
# }


# The data is stored in the database.
# When you query the database, you get SQLAlchemy objects.
# But FastAPI can't return those objects as JSON directly, so you use a Pydantic model with
# model_config = {"from_attributes": True} to convert those SQLAlchemy objects into JSON for the response.
